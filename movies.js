Rudolf arrived by the Orient Express in Strelsau to fish - not to attend the coronation: ('And that's what I came for, fishing, not coronations. I dont like coronations and I do like fishing'). It was recognized by the King's loyal advisors: Capt. Fritz von Tarlenheim (David Niven) and Colonel Zapt (C. Aubrey Smith), that Rudolf closely resembled the monarch. The dissolute King invited Rudolf to his hunting lodge for drinks and toasts - where it was revealed that there was enmity between the King and his half-brother Duke Michael (Raymond Massey), known as 'Black Michael,' with a band of rebels.",

When she came back she asked, 'How's my mother?' 'What mother?' 'My mother. She's here, she's in her room. Room 22.' They go up there. Different room, different wallpaper, everything. And the payoff of the whole story is, so the legend goes, that the woman had bubonic plague and they dared not let anybody know she died, otherwise all of Paris would have emptied.' The urban legend, known as the Vanishing Hotel Room, also formed the basis of one segment of the German portmanteau film Eerie Tales (1919), So Long at the Fair (1950) (in which the missing person was the young woman's brother as opposed to her mother) and Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Into Thin Air (1955), starring Hitchcock's daughter Patricia Hitchcock.",

If you select the 'Oscars' button you will get either a set of initials for Oscar nominated films from one randomly selected year, or you will get a set of initials of 5 Oscar winning films from a consecutive 5 year span between " + earliestYear + " and " + latestYear + ", but the order will be jumbled. To take a guess, enter the movie name in the text box and either press the enter key or click 'Sub'. Up to 3 hints are available for each film. These hints can be in the form of a word or short phrase, an audio clip, an image or a short video clip. Another helpful aide is to hover over and/or click on any of the initials displayed. That letter, along with the rest of the initials for the movie it is part of, will change color. When all else fails, you can select the 'Ans' button.
